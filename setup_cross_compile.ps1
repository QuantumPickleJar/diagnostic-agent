.SYNOPSIS
Set up cross-compilation environment for building ARM64 Docker images on Windows dev machine

.DESCRIPTION
This script prepares your Windows development machine for cross-compiling Docker images
to deploy to your Raspberry Pi. It installs Docker Desktop buildx and sets up the ARM64 platform.

.PARAMETER SetupOnly
Only sets up the environment without building
