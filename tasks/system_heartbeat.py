Module: system_heartbeat
=======================

This module provides a simple heartbeat mechanism for a diagnostic agent
running on a Raspberry Pi. The heartbeat periodically collects basic
system metrics such as uptime, CPU temperature, disk usage, and network
interface details. Collected data are stored in JSON format at a
configured path (`/agent_memory/connectivity.json` by default). The
module exposes a `start_heartbeat` function which spawns a daemon
thread to perform this work in the background.

Design considerations:

* **Efficiency**: The collector sleeps between cycles and avoids
  expensive operations. It uses Python's standard library where
  possible, falling back on `psutil` if available for more detailed
  metrics.
* **Resilience**: All data gathering operations are wrapped in
  `try/except` blocks. When a metric cannot be retrieved, a
  placeholder value such as ``"unavailable"`` is returned instead of
  raising an exception.
* **Extensibility**: New metrics can be added by defining helper
  functions similar to the existing ones and including them in the
  heartbeat data structure.

Example usage::

    from system_heartbeat import start_heartbeat
    # Start heartbeat thread with a 60â€‘second interval
    thread = start_heartbeat(interval=60)
    # Continue running your main application code...

Note that the thread is marked as a daemon; it will not prevent
program exit if the main thread finishes.
